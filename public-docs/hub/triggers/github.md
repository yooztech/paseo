# GitHub triggers

## Events

| `on`                                 | Fires when                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `github.issue_comment`               | A comment on an issue or pull request is created. |
| `github.issues`                      | An issue is opened or edited.                     |
| `github.pull_request_review`         | A review is submitted.                            |
| `github.pull_request_review_comment` | A comment is added to a diff.                     |

Which repositories produce events is set on the GitHub App installation. `filters.repo` narrows a trigger to one `owner/name` repository.

## Filters

```yaml
filters:
  repo: example/project
  contains: "@paseo"
  from_users: [maintainer]
```

`from_users` matches the sender's GitHub login. `contains` checks the event text; `pattern` checks its start. The text is the comment body for comments and reviews, and the issue title plus body for issues. All filters must pass.

## Invocation

Put the configured marker in the message, then put leading inputs in the text parsed after that marker:

```text
@paseo repo=project agent=claude investigate the failed sync
```

Hub consumes only declared consecutive headers and passes `investigate the failed sync` as `${{ paseo.prompt }}`. See [Hub workflows](/docs/hub/workflows) for input types, defaults, choices, and rejected Activity records.

## Credentials and replies

GitHub-triggered steps receive a scoped `GH_TOKEN` for the triggering repository. The agent can use `gh` to comment, push, and open a pull request. A step may also declare:

```yaml
allow_outputs:
  - type: github.reply
    max: 5
```

See the [workflow examples](/docs/hub/configuration/examples) for review and PR workflows.
