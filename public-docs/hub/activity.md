# Hub activity

Every event Hub accepts is recorded, whether or not it ran anything. That record is how you debug a trigger.

## Where to look

**Project → Activity** lists the events routed to that project: the event, its source, the result, and when it arrived.

The result column says what happened:

| Result                | Meaning                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A trigger name        | The event matched that trigger and dispatched                     |
| A lifecycle state     | The execution is in progress or finished                          |
| `no_matching_trigger` | The event reached the project, but no trigger's filters matched   |
| `provider_unrouted`   | No project route existed for the resource that produced the event |

**Project → Executions** lists the runs: which trigger, which configuration revision, which daemon, duration, and outcome.

**Connections → Known unrouted events** is the organization-level view. It holds events whose credential belongs to your organization but which no project's configuration claimed. A repository you connected but never named in a trigger lands here.

Those two are different problems. `no_matching_trigger` means your filters are wrong. An unrouted event means no configuration mentions that repository, workspace, or guild at all.

## Nothing happened when I mentioned the bot

Work down this list.

1. **Is the event in the project's Activity?** If not, check **Connections → Known unrouted events**. If it is there, no trigger names that resource. Add `filters.repo`, `filters.workspace`, or `filters.guild` and push.
2. **Is the event anywhere at all?** If not, the event never reached Hub. Check the provider's own delivery log: GitHub's App → Advanced → Recent Deliveries, or Slack's Event Subscriptions page. Then check that the app is subscribed to that event type.
3. **Is your user in `from_users`?** This is the most common cause. GitHub uses your login; Slack and Discord use the user ID, not the display name.
4. **Did the mention match?** On GitHub, `contains` must appear in the comment body. On Slack and Discord the bot must actually be mentioned, and `pattern` matches only at the start of the text after the mention.
5. **Is the configuration you think is active actually active?** The Configuration tab shows the active revision and the last sync attempt. A failed push leaves the old revision serving.
6. **Is the daemon connected?** An offline daemon fails dispatch with `daemon_not_connected`.
7. **Did it run and stop early?** Check the execution. An agent that never reports back is ended by `idle_timeout` after 5 minutes by default, or `timeout` after an hour.

## Sync failures

The Configuration tab shows the latest sync state:

| State                   | What to do                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fetch failed            | The file is missing at that commit, or the App can't read the repository |
| Invalid                 | Validation failed, or the config names something unreachable             |
| Superseded push ignored | A newer commit already moved the branch head; nothing is wrong           |

"Names something unreachable" is usually a repository the installation doesn't cover, a daemon that was renamed, or a connection slug that no longer exists. See [How Hub works](/docs/hub/concepts).

## Nothing is retried

Hub does not queue events. A dispatch that fails because the daemon was offline stays failed, so trigger it again once the daemon is back.
