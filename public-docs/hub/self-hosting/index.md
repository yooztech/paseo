# Self-hosting Hub

Hub is a Node service backed by PostgreSQL. Connecting external providers requires a public HTTPS URL for their callbacks and webhooks.

1. Deploy Hub with [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) or [Fly](#fly).
2. Create the [GitHub App](/docs/hub/self-hosting/github-app), [Slack app](/docs/hub/self-hosting/slack-app), and [Discord app](/docs/hub/self-hosting/discord-app) you want.
3. Follow the [quickstart](/docs/hub/quickstart).

Migrations run automatically at startup. Hub does not start listening when a migration fails.

## Configuration

Hub has one public URL and one persistent application secret:

| Variable                | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PASEO_HUB_APP_URL`     | Public origin used by the dashboard, authentication, and callbacks |
| `PASEO_HUB_AUTH_SECRET` | Protects browser sessions and derives execution credentials        |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | PostgreSQL connection string                                       |

Generate `PASEO_HUB_AUTH_SECRET` once and keep it across restarts:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Changing it signs everyone out and invalidates completion credentials for executions that are still running.

Bootstrap the first owner with:

```dotenv
PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_ORGANIZATION=My organization
PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL=me@example.com
PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-temporary-password
```

The password must be at least 12 characters. Sign in with it once, replace it in the dashboard, then remove `PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_PASSWORD` from the deployment. Hub keeps the account and organization.

### Providers

Set the group for each provider you intend to connect. A provider with missing credentials shows as **Setup needed** in Connections.

```sh
# GitHub
GITHUB_APP_SLUG=
GITHUB_APP_ID=
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=          # or GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Slack
SLACK_APP_ID=
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=

# Discord
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
```

See [GitHub](/docs/hub/self-hosting/github-app), [Slack](/docs/hub/self-hosting/slack-app), and [Discord](/docs/hub/self-hosting/discord-app) for where each value comes from.

## Docker Compose

The repository contains Hub and PostgreSQL as one Compose stack:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/getpaseo/hub.git
cd hub
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `PASEO_HUB_APP_URL`, `PASEO_HUB_AUTH_SECRET`, and the three bootstrap values in `.env`, then run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The stack publishes Hub on port `3000` and stores PostgreSQL data in a named volume. The Hub image is `ghcr.io/getpaseo/hub:latest`.

When a reverse proxy terminates HTTPS, set `PASEO_HUB_TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` to the header carrying the original client IP.

## Fly

Clone the repository and create an app and database under names you control:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/getpaseo/hub.git
cd hub
fly apps create your-hub
fly postgres create --name your-hub-db
fly postgres attach your-hub-db -a your-hub
```

Set the application secret and bootstrap account, along with credentials for the providers you use:

```sh
fly secrets set -a your-hub \
  PASEO_HUB_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_ORGANIZATION="My organization" \
  PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL=me@example.com \
  PASEO_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-temporary-password
```

Deploy the Dockerfile from the repository:

```sh
fly deploy -a your-hub \
  -e PASEO_HUB_APP_URL=https://your-hub.fly.dev
```

Keep one machine running. Hub holds the Discord gateway connection and dispatches events to daemons, so a stopped machine misses events.

## Upgrades

Pull the new image or source and deploy it. Migrations are forward-only. Back up PostgreSQL first; it contains configuration revisions, connections, and execution history.
