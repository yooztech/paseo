// A preview renders a self-contained document and nothing else. Inline styles and
// scripts run so a plan page keeps its layout and its diagrams; fetch, XHR,
// WebSocket, beacon, remote script, remote font, remote image, and form posts are
// all refused. Agent-written HTML is not trusted markup.
//
// What this does NOT stop: the document navigating itself. No CSP directive
// available in current browsers prevents it — `navigate-to` was dropped from CSP3
// and is unenforced, and `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` needs no script at all
// (both verified against the Chromium this app ships against). So a hostile page
// can still reach a server by navigating, carrying data available inside the
// preview. The opaque origin is what bounds the damage: the frame has no storage,
// no parent access, and no way to read any file but itself. Native narrows it
// further in html-preview.tsx, because a WebView can refuse navigation outside CSP — see the
// caveat there on why that is a mitigation rather than a guarantee.

//
// Locating the document's own doctype to insert after it means reimplementing the
// tokenizer's initial insertion mode: its exact whitespace set (JS `\s` matches
// characters HTML does not, and one stray NBSP is enough to push the policy into
// the body where it stops applying), every comment ending including `--!>`, `<!-->`
// and `<!--->`, bogus-comment tokens like `<?xml …?>` and `<![CDATA[…]]>`, and the
// rule that a doctype closes at the first `>` in every state. Each of those rules
// cost a bug before it was right.
//
// So the prologue isn't found, it's supplied: our doctype, then the policy, then
// the file verbatim. The file's own doctype becomes a stray DOCTYPE token, which
// the parser ignores wherever it appears. Standards mode is guaranteed, the policy
// is always the first element and therefore always in the head, and no part of the
// document has to be parsed to place it.
