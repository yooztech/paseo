# Release

All workspaces share one version and release together.

## Two steps

A release has exactly two steps. The agent does the first, the user authorizes the second.

**Preparation** (local, reversible — agent does this):

- format, lint, typecheck all green
- ACP provider catalog drift checked with `npm run acp:version-drift:check`;
  if stale package-runner pins are intentional, say so explicitly, otherwise run
  `npm run acp:version-drift:update` and commit the updated catalog
- classify the previous-stable-to-`HEAD` diff as patch or minor, then show the
  target version and rationale to the user
- draft the changelog, show it to the user, wait for review
- run the pre-release sanity check, surface findings to the user
- confirm CI is green

**Go-ahead** (user says "go ahead"):

- commit the approved changelog
- run the release

Rules that apply to both steps:

- Last-minute changes always need approval. Every time.
- No code changes bundled into the changelog commit or the release commit. Code shims live in their own commit, reviewed on their own merits.
- A sanity-check finding is information, not a directive. The agent surfaces it; the user decides.
- Invoking a release skill is intent to start the flow, not blanket authorization to publish.
- If the user asks for a release preview, show the prospective changelog/release contents and answer questions, but do not commit, tag, publish, or run release commands until they explicitly authorize the release.

## Two paths

There are two supported ways to ship from `main`:

1. **Direct stable release**: you are ready to ship the current `main` commit to everyone immediately.
2. **Beta flow**: release candidates on the `beta` channel. Betas carry an in-place changelog entry (beta users check it), publish npm only on the explicit `beta` dist-tag, and never move the website download target off the latest stable.

Paseo has one linear release track even though npm dist-tags are independent
pointers. The npm invariant is:

- A beta release moves only `beta`; `latest` remains on the newest stable.
- A stable release moves both `latest` and `beta` to that stable version. This
  keeps users who install `@getpaseo/cli@beta` on the newest Paseo release after
  a beta is promoted or superseded by a direct stable release.

## Release version decision

Every fresh release starts by classifying the full previous-stable-to-`HEAD`
diff. The highest-impact change determines the version:

- **Minor** — a user would experience the release as a significant upgrade. This
  includes substantial new workflows, providers, forges, platforms, integrations,
  or meaningful expansions of existing capabilities. Foundational internal work
  also qualifies when it materially changes reliability, performance,
  compatibility, deployment, or operation; diff size alone does not.
- **Patch** — fixes, polish, small enhancements, and reliability or performance
  improvements within existing capabilities. Follow-up corrections to a minor
  release are patches.

The release agent selects patch or minor during preparation and presents the
target version with the changelog for approval. Agents never select a major
version autonomously. A major release requires an explicit user instruction and
approval; Paseo remains on major version zero until that deliberate decision.

Version bumps are never used to retry a failed build. Retry the existing version
as described in **Fixing a failed release build**.

## Standard release (stable)

Before running any stable release command:

- Make sure the intended release commit is already committed to `main` and the working tree is clean.
- **Run `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` and commit any resulting changes BEFORE you start any `release:*` command.** `release:check` runs `npm install --workspaces --include-workspace-root` as part of `release:prepare`, which can mutate `package-lock.json` (e.g. churning `"dev": true` markers on optional deps). The next step, `version:all:*`, runs `npm version` which aborts when the working tree is dirty. If this happens mid-flight you have to commit the lockfile churn before retrying — and the pre-commit format hook will reject a lockfile-only commit because oxfmt internally skips `package-lock.json` while lefthook's glob still matches it. Avoid the whole mess by running format/lint/typecheck first, then `release:prepare` once on its own to absorb any lockfile churn into a normal commit, then start the release.
- Do not use a release command as a substitute for checking whether the current commit is actually ready.

```bash
# Run exactly one, matching the approved decision:
npm run release:patch
npm run release:minor
```

This bumps the version across all workspaces, runs checks, publishes to npm, and pushes the branch + tag. In this fork, the tag push triggers `Desktop Release` and `Release Notes Sync` on GitHub Actions, plus the EAS workflow in `packages/app/.eas/workflows/release-mobile.yml` (see "Mobile builds (EAS)" below). Web app deployment, Docker publishing, and Android APK publishing are manual-only.

After the stable release succeeds, move npm's `beta` pointer to the new stable
version for every published package. This changes dist-tags only; do not
republish the packages:

```bash
PASEO_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
for package in highlight relay protocol client server cli; do
  npm dist-tag add "@getpaseo/$package@$PASEO_VERSION" beta
done
```

Verify both npm tags now resolve to `PASEO_VERSION` before considering the
stable release complete.

The Docker workflow is manual-only in this fork. Fork CI and release tags do not build or publish container images.

The production relay is the Elixir service in [getpaseo/paseo-relay](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo-relay), with its own deployment process. Paseo releases and pushes to this repository do not deploy it. The Cloudflare relay code and workflow in this repository are legacy and are not used in production.

**Stable means stable.** If the user says "stable" or "ship stable", do not ask whether they want a beta first. They picked stable; treat it as a direct stable release. Only run the beta flow when the user explicitly says "beta".

## Manual step-by-step

```bash
npm run typecheck            # Verify the exact commit you intend to release
npm run release:check        # Typecheck, build, dry-run pack
# Run exactly one approved version command:
npm run version:all:patch
npm run version:all:minor
npm run release:publish      # Publish to npm
npm run release:push         # Push HEAD + tag (triggers CI workflows)
# Then move npm's beta dist-tag to this stable version using the command above.
```

## Beta flow

```bash
npm run release:beta:patch       # Start the next patch beta line
npm run release:beta:minor       # Start the next minor beta line
# ... test desktop and APK prerelease assets from GitHub Releases ...
npm run release:beta:next        # Optional: cut X.Y.Z-beta.2, beta.3, ...
npm run release:promote          # Promote X.Y.Z-beta.N to stable X.Y.Z
```

- Beta tags are published GitHub prereleases like `v0.1.41-beta.1`
- Betas publish npm packages with `--tag beta`, so `npm install @getpaseo/cli@beta` opts in while plain `npm install @getpaseo/cli` stays on `latest`
- Betas publish desktop assets and APKs for testing, but they do not trigger the production web/mobile release flows
- `release:promote` creates a fresh stable tag like `v0.1.41`; the final release never reuses the beta tag
- Desktop assets now come from the Electron package at `packages/desktop`
- Beta releases use Electron's `beta` update channel. Users on the stable channel only receive stable releases; users on the beta channel receive beta releases and the final stable release when it is published.
- **Betas carry a changelog entry.** Beta users read release notes, so each beta updates an in-place `CHANGELOG.md` entry (`## X.Y.Z-beta.N`) that `Release Notes Sync` mirrors into the prerelease body on the tag push. The entry is intermediary: promotion overwrites it in place with the final stable entry, so no `-beta.N` heading is ever left behind. See the Changelog policy section.

Use the beta path when you need to:

- smoke a build yourself before promoting it to everyone
- test a build manually in a Linux or Windows VM
- send a build to a user who is hitting a specific problem
- iterate on `beta.1`, `beta.2`, `beta.3`, and so on before deciding to ship broadly

## Desktop release publication

The Release is created when the tag is pushed. The macOS, Linux, and Windows jobs upload installers and packages as they complete, then `finalize-release` merges the platform manifests, stamps `rolloutHours: 0`, and uploads them.

While a channel manifest is not yet available, the desktop updater treats its 404 as no update. Other updater failures remain visible. Once the manifest is uploaded, all users can update immediately on their next check.

`Release Notes Sync` creates a missing Release on tag pushes and updates its body from the changelog.

There is no staged rollout or rollback. `allowDowngrade = false`; ship a superseding hotfix for a bad release.

## Mobile builds (EAS)

iOS store builds are not in `.github/workflows`. The EAS GitHub app runs `packages/app/.eas/workflows/release-mobile.yml` when a `v*-fork.*` tag is pushed:

- **iOS (TestFlight)** — EAS builds with profile `production` and uploads to TestFlight. App Store review is a separate manual action.
- **Android APK** — not part of fork releases. `.github/workflows/android-apk-release.yml` is manual-only.

`packages/app/app.config.js` derives the base native version code as `major * 1_000_000 + minor * 1_000 + patch`. For fork releases, the EAS and GitHub APK workflows pass the tag and both Android `versionCode` and iOS `buildNumber` use `base version code * 1_000 + fork number`; `v0.2.5-fork.1` uses `2005001`. Fork numbers must be between 1 and 999. EAS uses the local version source so the value in each binary is deterministic from the tag.

### Watching mobile builds from the terminal

Use the EAS CLI from `packages/app/`:

```bash
cd packages/app

# Recent builds (newest first). Pipe to jq for status only.
npx eas build:list --limit 8 --non-interactive --json | jq '.[] | {platform, status, appVersion, gitCommitHash}'

# Recent EAS workflow runs. This is the source of truth for submit/review jobs.
npx eas workflow:runs --json | jq '.[] | {status, workflowName, trigger, gitCommitHash, startedAt, finishedAt}'

# Filter by platform.
npx eas build:list --platform ios --limit 5 --non-interactive --json
npx eas build:list --platform android --limit 5 --non-interactive --json

# Inspect a specific build.
npx eas build:view <build-id>

# Inspect the full release workflow, including build_ios and submit_ios.
npx eas workflow:view <workflow-run-id> --json

# Read failed submit/review job logs.
npx eas workflow:logs <workflow-job-id> --all-steps --non-interactive

# Stream logs for a build.
npx eas build:view <build-id> --json | jq '.logFiles[]'
```

A build's `gitCommitHash` must match the release tag commit. `status` walks through `NEW` → `IN_QUEUE` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `FINISHED` (or `ERRORED`/`CANCELED`). The EAS workflow run's `gitCommitHash` and `trigger` must also match the release tag.

Once a build is `FINISHED`, EAS must still upload iOS to TestFlight. The mobile release is not done until that submission succeeds.

For the `Release Mobile` EAS workflow, these jobs must pass:

- `build_ios` — iOS binary built
- `submit_ios` — iOS binary uploaded to App Store Connect/TestFlight

Do not treat `build_ios: SUCCESS` as a completed iOS release. `submit_ios` must also succeed.

To confirm the submission landed, inspect the EAS workflow with `npx eas workflow:view <workflow-run-id> --json`. App Store Connect (review state for the matching version/build) and the Play Console track are the final ground truth.

### Babysitting mobile after a release

The user rarely opens the Expo dashboard. A failed EAS build or submit/review job can sit silently until users complain about a stale version. After every stable release, set up a long-delay babysit that re-checks GitHub Actions, EAS builds, and the EAS `Release Mobile` workflow for the release tag. If any build is `ERRORED`/`CANCELED`, any workflow is `FAILURE`, or any required submit/review job fails, surface it immediately. If all builds are `FINISHED` and all required submit/review jobs are `SUCCESS`, confirm and stop.

**Use `create_heartbeat`, never `create_schedule`, for release babysitting.** Babysitting fires back into the current conversation as a wake-up prompt. `create_schedule` starts a fresh agent the user has to find and read; `create_heartbeat` surfaces the build status inline in the conversation that owns the release, where it is impossible to miss. If you find yourself reaching for `create_schedule` for a release babysit, you are about to ship a status report into a void.

Pattern:

```jsonc
// mcp__paseo__create_heartbeat arguments
{
  "name": "vX.Y.Z release babysit heartbeat",
  "cron": "*/15 * * * *",
  "maxRuns": 8, // covers ~2h of build + store-submission window
  "prompt": "Heartbeat: check vX.Y.Z-fork.N release. Run gh run list, eas build:list, eas workflow:runs, and eas workflow:view for the matching Release Mobile run. Report concisely. The release is not done until desktop/APK workflows are green, the iOS EAS build is FINISHED, and submit_ios is SUCCESS. Flag any ERRORED/FAILED/CANCELED/FAILURE loudly.",
}
```

Tight cadence on purpose. The first run fires immediately, giving a near-real-time status check before the conversation closes. Subsequent runs at 15-minute intervals catch build and TestFlight upload failures quickly. Keep the prompt short — the heartbeat is a status probe, not a research task — and have it bail out as soon as the build is in TestFlight so the remaining runs do not generate noise.

## Release notes on GitHub

The GitHub Release body is populated automatically by the `Release Notes Sync` workflow (`.github/workflows/release-notes-sync.yml`). It triggers on every `v*` tag push and on any push to `main` that touches `CHANGELOG.md`, then runs `scripts/sync-release-notes-from-changelog.mjs` to mirror the matching changelog entry into the release body. You don't need to write release notes on GitHub manually — keep `CHANGELOG.md` correct and the workflow will sync it. To force a re-sync, dispatch the workflow with the tag input.

## Website behavior

- The website download page points to GitHub's latest published **stable** release.
- Published beta prereleases are public on GitHub Releases, but they do **not** become the website download target.
- The download target only moves when you publish the final stable release tag like `v0.1.41`.
- The public `/changelog` page renders `CHANGELOG.md` as-is, so the in-flight `-beta.N` entry shows there once it lands on `main` — that's intended, it's where beta users check what's coming. Only the **download target** stays pinned to the latest stable; the download links read GitHub's releases API, not the changelog, so a `-beta.N` heading on top never affects them.
- The website itself is deployed by `Deploy Website` (Cloudflare Workers), which redeploys on `release: published` for non-prerelease releases and on pushes to `main` that touch `CHANGELOG.md` or `packages/website/**`.

## Fixing a failed release build

**NEVER bump the version to fix a build problem.** New versions are reserved for meaningful product changes (features, fixes, improvements). Build/CI failures are fixed on the current version.

**Do not rely on `workflow_dispatch` for tagged code fixes.** The `workflow_dispatch` trigger runs the workflow file from the default branch but checks out the code at the tag ref (`ref: ${{ inputs.tag }}`). That means fixes committed to `main` won't change the tagged source tree being built. `workflow_dispatch` only helps when the fix lives in the workflow file itself.

Docker publishing is manual-only. Use workflow dispatch if a container image is needed:

```bash
gh workflow run docker.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f paseo_version=X.Y.Z-beta.N \
  -f publish=true
```

This publishes `ghcr.io/yooztech/paseo:X.Y.Z-beta.N` without touching desktop or EAS release builders. The dispatch runs from `--ref main` and uses the explicit `paseo_version`.

To retry a failed release workflow, push a retry tag on the commit
you want to build. Reusing the same tag name is expected: move it with
`git tag -f ...` and push it with `--force` so the workflow rebuilds the commit
you actually want.

Prefer a tag push over `workflow_dispatch` when rebuilding desktop release assets. Use Docker workflow dispatch only when explicitly publishing a container image.

The retry tag patterns below still work and remain the supported way to rebuild specific release targets:

```bash
# Desktop (all platforms)
git tag -f desktop-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-v0.1.28 --force

# Desktop (single platform)
git tag -f desktop-macos-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-macos-v0.1.28 --force
git tag -f desktop-linux-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-linux-v0.1.28 --force
git tag -f desktop-windows-v0.1.28 HEAD && git push origin desktop-windows-v0.1.28 --force

# Beta
git tag -f v0.1.29-beta.2 HEAD && git push origin v0.1.29-beta.2 --force
```

This ensures the checkout ref matches the actual code on `main` with the fix included.

- `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` rebuilds the full tagged release
- `desktop-vX.Y.Z` rebuilds desktop for all desktop platforms only
- `desktop-macos-vX.Y.Z`, `desktop-linux-vX.Y.Z`, and `desktop-windows-vX.Y.Z` rebuild only that desktop platform

## Notes

- `version:all:*` bumps root + syncs workspace versions and `@getpaseo/*` dependency versions
- `release:prepare` refreshes workspace `node_modules` links to prevent stale types
- `npm run dev:desktop` and `npm run build:desktop` target the Electron desktop package in `packages/desktop`
- If `release:publish` partially fails, re-run it — npm skips already-published versions
- If `release:publish:beta` partially fails, re-run it — npm skips already-published versions and keeps prereleases off `latest` because every publish uses `--tag beta`
- The website uses GitHub's latest published release API for download links, so published beta prereleases do not replace the stable download target.

## Changelog format

Release notes depend on the changelog heading format. The heading **must** be strictly followed:

```
## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD
## X.Y.Z-beta.N - YYYY-MM-DD
```

No prefix (`v`), no extra text. `Release Notes Sync` matches the `## X.Y.Z` (or `## X.Y.Z-beta.N`) line for the pushed tag to extract the version. A malformed heading breaks the release-notes sync for that tag.

## Changelog policy

- `CHANGELOG.md` includes stable releases and the current beta line.
- The first beta of a version inserts a top entry like `## 0.1.60-beta.1 - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Each subsequent beta updates that same top entry in place — bump the heading (`0.1.60-beta.1` → `0.1.60-beta.2`) and fold in whatever else landed.
- Stable promotion updates that same entry in place one last time: heading to `0.1.60`, date to the promotion day.
- One entry per version line. The `-beta.N` heading is intermediary — overwrite it, never append. Don't leave stale `-beta.N` entries behind and don't create a duplicate entry per beta.
- It always covers the full diff from the previous stable tag, regardless of how many betas were cut in between.

## Changelog ownership

- **The agent running the release writes the changelog entry — beta or stable.** Do not hand the changelog to another model or agent. The release agent has the release context and owns the final wording.
- Draft the entry from the previous-stable-to-`HEAD` diff, review it against the changelog policy below, show it to the user, and wait for approval before committing it. Each beta refreshes the same entry; promotion refreshes it one last time from the full previous-stable-to-`HEAD` diff.

## Changelog voice

The changelog is shown on the Paseo homepage. Write it for **end users**, not developers.

- **Frame everything from the user's perspective.** Describe what changed in the app, not what changed in the code. Users care that "workspaces load instantly" — not that a component no longer remounts.
- **Never mention component names, internal modules, or implementation details.** No `WorkingIndicator`, no `accumulatedUsage`, no `reconcileAndEmitWorkspaceUpdates`. Also no "virtualized lists", no "remount", no "memoization", no "debounced", no "fuzzy ranking", no "controlled input", no "uncontrolled input" — these are implementation words masquerading as user-facing copy.
- **Concrete WRONG → RIGHT examples** (real mistakes from past releases):

  | Wrong (implementation-facing)                                                       | Right (user-facing)                                         |
  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Switching layouts no longer remounts the active agent                               | Splitting a pane no longer loses your scroll position       |
  | Model, mode, and thinking pickers — searchable virtualized lists with fuzzy ranking | Mobile model selector is faster and more straightforward    |
  | Text inputs in mobile sheets no longer flicker while typing fast                    | Typing in mobile sheets no longer flickers                  |
  | Compact web sheets no longer crash when swiped to dismiss                           | Sheets on mobile web no longer crash when swiped to dismiss |
  | Reduced re-renders in the agent list                                                | Agent list scrolls smoothly                                 |
  | Added debouncing to the search input                                                | Search results no longer lag behind typing                  |

  Test: would a non-developer reader recognise what changed when using the app? If they'd need an engineer to translate ("what's a remount?"), the bullet is still implementation-facing — rewrite it as the symptom the user experiences.

- **Collapse internal iterations.** If a feature was added and then fixed within the same release, just list the feature as working. Users never saw the broken version.
- **Only list changes relative to the previous stable release.** The diff is `v(previous)..HEAD`. If something was introduced and fixed between those two tags, it never shipped — don't mention the fix.
  - **Common trap:** when drafting from `git log`, every commit looks like a separate bullet — including the "fix X" commits that landed on top of a brand-new feature in the same release window. Before listing a Fixed entry, check whether the thing being fixed was itself added in this same release. If so, drop the fix and fold it into the feature bullet.
  - **Example:** if the release adds an in-app browser and also contains a commit "fix: browser pane keyboard handling no longer steals shortcuts", do **not** list the keyboard fix under Fixed. The browser is shipping for the first time, so users will only ever see the working version. The Added entry covers it.
- **Cut low-signal entries.** "Toolbar buttons have consistent sizing" is too granular. Combine small polish items or drop them.

## Changelog conciseness

Every bullet must be scannable at a glance. The changelog is not release documentation — it's a list.

- **One sentence per bullet, max.** If a bullet contains two sentences, the second one is doing work that belongs in product docs, not the changelog. Cut it.
- **No trailing periods.** Bullets are list items, not prose. Drop the period at the end of every bullet, including the period inside any bolded lead-in. `**Configurable terminal scrollback**` not `**Configurable terminal scrollback.**`.
- **One line per bullet.** If a bullet wraps to three lines in a narrow column, it's too long.
- **Split bullets that pack multiple distinct changes.** If a bullet uses "and", "plus", a comma list, or an em-dash to chain several independent improvements, break them into separate bullets — even when they share a theme or author. One bullet = one user-facing change.
- **Trim qualifying clauses.** Drop "with a hint shown when…", "matching the CLI's behaviour", "across common install shapes". If the detail doesn't change whether a user cares, cut it.
- **Lead with what the user can do, not the mechanism.** The reader cares about the capability, not how it works under the hood. Do not explain LAN vs WAN, TLS handshakes, IPC, the daemon-relay topology, or any internal concept the user has not asked about. "Self-hosted relays can use a different TLS setting for the public endpoint" — not "Self-hosted relays support a separate TLS setting for the public endpoint, so the daemon can reach the relay over the LAN while the phone reaches it over the public secure address." If a feature genuinely needs background to be understood, it belongs in product docs, with a one-line teaser in the changelog.
- **Lead with the outcome.** "Windows: agents launch reliably from npm `.cmd` shims…" is better than "Windows: agents launch reliably across common install shapes. Claude, Codex, and OpenCode now start correctly…".
- **Attribution follows the split.** When you split a dense bullet, move each PR/author to the bullet it belongs to. Never duplicate the same PR across multiple bullets.

## Changelog attribution

Every changelog bullet must credit contributors and link to the PR(s) that delivered the change. This is not one-PR-per-line — a single bullet describes a user-facing change and may reference multiple PRs.

Format: append `([#123](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/123) by [@user](https://github.com/user))` at the end of each bullet. For changes spanning multiple PRs or contributors:

```markdown
- Voice mode now works on tablets with proper microphone permissions. ([#210](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/210), [#215](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/215) by [@alice](https://github.com/alice), [@bob](https://github.com/bob))
```

Rules:

- **Always link the PR number** as `[#N](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/N)`.
- **Always link the contributor's GitHub profile** as `[@user](https://github.com/user)`.
- **One bullet = one user-facing change**, regardless of how many PRs went into it. Group related PRs on the same bullet.
- **De-duplicate contributors.** If the same person authored multiple PRs in one bullet, list them once.
- **Only credit external contributors.** Skip attribution for [@boudra](https://github.com/boudra). The changelog credits community contributions — core team work is the default.
- **Credit the commit author, not the PR opener.** A maintainer often opens a PR that lands work authored by someone else (cherry-pick, rebase of a contributor's branch, manual extraction from a stacked PR). The squash commit preserves the original commit's author, but `gh pr view N --json author` returns the PR opener — using that field will silently mis-credit the work to the maintainer (and then the "skip @boudra" rule drops the attribution entirely). Always resolve attribution from commit authors.

  Use this command to get the GitHub logins for each PR:

  ```bash
  gh pr view N --json commits --jq '[.commits[].authors[].login] | unique | .[]'
  ```

  This returns every distinct GitHub login that authored or co-authored a commit in the PR. Use those logins for attribution. Fall back to `gh pr view N --json author` only if the commits command returns nothing (which should not happen for merged PRs).

  When listing PR numbers, `git log --format='%H %s' v<previous>..HEAD | grep -E '\(#[0-9]+\)$'` pulls the PR number out of squash commit subjects.

## Changelog ordering

Entries within each section (Added, Improved, Fixed) are ordered by user impact:

1. **User-facing features and changes first** — things users will notice, want to try, or that change their workflow.
2. **Quality-of-life improvements** — polish, performance, smoother interactions.
3. **Internal/infra changes last** — only include if they have a tangible user benefit (e.g. "faster startup" is user-facing even if the fix was internal).

## Pre-release sanity check

Before cutting a **stable** release, the release agent reviews the diff as a last line of defence against shipping bugs. Skip this for betas — the beta itself is the smoke test, and gating each beta on a code review defeats the point of using betas as fast release candidates.

Review the diff between the latest release tag and `HEAD`. Focus on:

1. **Breaking changes** — especially in the WebSocket protocol, agent lifecycle, and any server↔client contract.
2. **Backward compatibility** — the important direction is old app clients talking to newly updated daemons. Users update desktop and daemon first, then keep running the old app for a while. Flag anything that breaks old clients against new daemons or requires both sides to update in lockstep.
3. **Regressions** — anything that looks like it could break existing functionality.

Use `git diff <latest-release-tag>..HEAD` as the review input. This is a deep sanity check, not a full code review. If anything looks risky, investigate before proceeding and surface the finding to the user.

## Changelog scope

The changelog always covers **previous-stable-to-`HEAD`**, beta and stable alike:

- **Beta release**: the entry covers `previous stable tag → HEAD`. Update the current in-place beta entry; don't start a fresh one per beta.
- **Stable promotion**: the same entry is promoted in place. It still captures the full delta from the previous stable release, not just what changed since the last beta.

Betas are checkpoints along the way; the entry is the single record for the jump from one stable version to the next, and beta users read it in the meantime.

## Completion checklist

### Beta release

- [ ] Working tree is clean and the intended commit is on `main`
- [ ] Update the in-place beta entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (heading `## X.Y.Z-beta.N - YYYY-MM-DD`), review it against the changelog policy, get approval, and commit it before cutting the release
- [ ] The previous-stable-to-`HEAD` diff is classified as patch or minor, with the target version and rationale approved

### Fork release

- [ ] Run the pre-release sanity check (see above) and address any findings
- [ ] The previous-stable-to-`HEAD` diff is classified as patch or minor, with the target version and rationale approved
- [ ] Ensure the intended release commit is already committed and the git worktree is clean before running any release command
- [ ] Ensure local `npm run typecheck` passes on that exact commit before running any release command
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-facing release notes (features, fixes — not refactors). When promoting from beta, overwrite the existing `## X.Y.Z-beta.N` heading in place (heading → `X.Y.Z`, date → promotion day) — do not add a new entry on top of the beta one
- [ ] Verify the changelog heading follows strict `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` format
